# Nand2Tetris — Part 1

This repository contains my implementations and projects for **Nand2Tetris Part 1**,  
where a complete computer is built **from first principles** — starting with logic gates.

---

## 📘 About the Course

Nand2Tetris Part 1 focuses on:

- Boolean logic and gates
- Combinational and sequential chips
- ALU design
- CPU construction
- Assembler and virtual machine foundations

The goal is to understand **how software ultimately runs on hardware**.

🎯 Learning Objective

By completing this repository, I aim to:

Understand computation from NAND gates upward

Gain intuition for CPU and memory design

Build confidence in low-level system abstractions

Strengthen foundations for OS, compilers, and backend systems

🔭 Notes

Projects are implemented incrementally

All designs are tested using the official Nand2Tetris tools

READMEs may be added inside project folders for explanations
